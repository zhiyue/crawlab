  addNodeInstruction: `
You cannot add nodes directly on the web interface in Crawlab.

Adding a node is quite simple. The only thing you have to do is to run a Crawlab service on your target machine.

For details, please refer to the [Multi-Node Deployment Documentation](https://docs.crawlab.cn/Installation/MultiNode.html).
